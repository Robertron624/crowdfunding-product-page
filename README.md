## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styling
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) - For modals

### What I learned

With this project I learned to work input radios and using its values for defining and altering the app state.

### Continued development

I want to start working in projects that require form handling and I'm planning on using other UI components library different from MaterialUI, maybe ChakraUI or DaisyUI.

### Useful resources
